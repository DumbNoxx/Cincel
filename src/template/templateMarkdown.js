## The Markdown Preview 
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`javascript
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine === '' && lastLine === '') {
    // it will return a multi-line code block.
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or... _italic_.
Or... **_both!_**
And finally, a ~~strikethrough~~ text.

There are [links](https://nxus-website.vercel.app), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get crazy, even tables:

| Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header? |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Your table content can be here. | And here. | And here too... |
| And here. | Okay, I think you get the point. | Let's add one more... |

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
